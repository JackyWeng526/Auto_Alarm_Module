# Auto_Alarm_Module

In this repository, you can use Excel to manage the alarm rules and send line message when you get some data-driven event.


## Alarm rules

The format of the alarm rules and conditions in this repository is a customized template in my own cases.

You can transform the format to suit your application situation.

## Line Message

By the python script and test-template in this repository, you can practice to send alarm through line message if you have registered Line Notify API.

The content of the line message can also be modified to suit your application situation.
